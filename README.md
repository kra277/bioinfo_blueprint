# Abstract
The reproducibility crisis in bioinformatics stems from software version conflicts, inconsistent computing environments, and poor documentation, leading to irreproducible results and inefficiencies in long-term research projects. Unlike computational workflows designed for immediate execution, bioinformatics projects often span extended periods, requiring researchers to revisit, modify, and reproduce analyses months or years later. Changes in software ecosystems, data formats, and personnel turnover further exacerbate these challenges. To address these issues, we present a modular, academic-scale framework that integrates containerized execution (Singularity/Rocker), workflow automation (Nextflow), structured data management, and interactive reporting (Flexdashboard) to ensure long-term reproducibility and collaborative efficiency. Unlike pre-built pipeline management solutions that may introduce unnecessary computational overhead, our approach selectively integrates only essential tools, reducing complexity while maintaining flexibility. Our framework incorporates a dual-container system, where a Singularity container executes computationally intensive batch processing tasks on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, while a Rocker container provides a controlled R environment for interactive downstream analysis. Reproducible reports and self-contained HTML dashboards allow results to be easily shared and explored without requiring additional software installations or internet access. Additionally, we implement a structured data management strategy that ensures the long-term accessibility and integrity of analyses. This framework has been successfully applied across multiple bioinformatics workflows, including Bulk RNA-seq, 16S microbiome sequencing, Methyl Capture-Seq, and SNP-based analyses. By ensuring computational reproducibility, facilitating seamless collaboration, and maintaining long-term data accessibility, our approach provides a practical, scalable, and accessible solution for bioinformatics research groups.

# Example Scenarios
This repository includes illustrative examples that demonstrate the application of the Blueprint workflow across diverse bioinformatics pipelines. Each example employs publicly available datasets to showcase a complete end-to-end process from data preprocessing and containerized execution to automated analysis and interactive reporting. These scenarios highlight key features of the framework, including its modular design, reproducibility, and scalability, thereby enabling researchers to adapt the workflow to various analytical contexts with confidence.

The following examples are showcased:
- Differntial Abundance Analysis (DAA) using 16S rRNA sequencing data
- Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis using Bulk RNA sequencing data
- Differential Methylation Analysis (DMA) usign EPIC array data.
